# ModularUI TODO's

- make api good
- Item/Fluid slot
- A good way to semi-auto determine size and pos of widgets
- gui color style (like background)  
- Window System
- JSON support guis  
- Drag widgets around in develop mode

## Window System
A gui should not be a single screen with a bunch of widgets, but a stack of windows where each window is it's own gui.
